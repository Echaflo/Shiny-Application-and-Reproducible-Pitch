## Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch


### This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project is:


#### To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and

#### To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.
##### The code used for the Shiny application can be found under:
    https://github.com/pvv88/shiny-application-and-reproducible-pitch.

#### Using this url, we have loaded earthquakes since the start of 2010 that had a 
##### magnitude of 7 and above, within a 6,000 kilometer radius of the geographic center of the Mexico city 
    https://pvv88.shinyapps.io/project.

#### The reproducible pitch presentation about this application is available under:
    http://rpubs.com/pvv88/presentation.
