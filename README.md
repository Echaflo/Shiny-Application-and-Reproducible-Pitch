### This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project is:


#### To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and

#### To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.
##### The code used for the Shiny application can be found under:
       https://github.com/Echaflo/Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch

#### Using this url, we have loaded earthquakes since the start of 2010 that had a 
##### magnitude of 7 and above, within a 6,000 kilometer radius of the geographic center of the Mexico city
